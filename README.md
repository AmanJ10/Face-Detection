# Face Detection
 
This is Deep Face Detection Model built from scratch.

## Dependencies

This project makes use of several Python libraries and frameworks to achieve accurate face detection. Some of the key dependencies include:

- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning library for model development.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **Albumentations**: Employed for data augmentation to enhance model performance.
- **Label Me**: A labeling tool used to annotate the training dataset.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the results and model performance.

Please ensure that you have these dependencies installed in your environment to run the project successfully.



## Model Accuracy

Please note that while this face detection model is a functional and valuable tool, it may not be 100% accurate in all scenarios. Face detection is a challenging computer vision task, and the model's performance depends on factors such as lighting conditions, image quality, and the diversity of faces in our dataset.

**Improvements in Progress**: I am actively working on refining and improving the model's accuracy. My goal is to make it more robust and capable of handling a wider range of scenarios.

**Contributions Welcome**: I welcome contributions from the open-source community to help enhance the model's performance. If you have ideas, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I appreciate your understanding and patience as I continue to make this model more powerful and reliable for face detection tasks.
